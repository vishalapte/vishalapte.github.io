Education â€¢ **Advanced Math**

## Why study advanced math at all?

A friend and fellow parent recently said to me:

> I think training for advanced math is very valuable even if you don't end up doing the competition part of it. My reason for why is going to sound very biased but here goes:
>
> Math teaching in high school, across the world now, has become what I call monkey math -- the teacher introduces a bunch of patterns and the kid who can remember the maximum number of patterns wins. No-one has to think about a problem for hours or days and push themselves to solve an original problem.
>
> The fabled Indian IIT entrance process too has been corrupted, where students are being professionally coached for IIT classes starting grade 5. So kids aren't really learning how to solve a problem, they just have the enhanced capacity to identify a larger set of patterns.
>
> The standard American system is by far the weakest, because not only are the topics taught in high school limited, they are taught at a very superficial level. The letter grading system further obscures the level of understanding where even an A+ doesn't mean a 100%. Added to this the pressure to go beyond AP, leads to students spending even less time learning how to solve tough problems, a skill that is essential to computer science, engineering and mathematics. So most students who have done AP Calculus and feel they are at the top of their Math class will still struggle in a college Math class because that is the first time they will be solving a truly unseen problem. Of course these are still smart kids so they muddle through but with a lot more stress than had they been trained right.
>
> Ironically, most colleges also now cater to a student who just wants to get by, by offering a different version of the Math course and labeling the real course an honors course or course for Math Majors or CS Majors only.
>
> In my view, if you want to consider yourself good at Math, you must be able to attempt harder problems and become good at problem solving more than studying new topics.

## Problem Solving

In [The Math Evangelist Who Preaches Problem-Solving](https://www.quantamagazine.org/richard-rusczyk-is-a-math-evangelist-who-preaches-problem-solving-20220913/), the founder of Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) puts across his argument in an elegant form.

## The Art of Problem Solving (AoPS)

AoPS is the main training program for the American Math Contest, International Math Olympiad, etc. AoPS has an [online](https://artofproblemsolving.com/online) offering.

## Benchmarking yourself

### American Mathematics Contest (AMC)

There are two levels [American Mathematics Contest 10](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AMC_10) and [American Mathematics Contest 12](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AMC_12). These are administered by the [Mathematical Association of America](https://maa.org/). You get a score which you can report to colleges if you like. If you are a certain level you get invited to take the next level of exam which also has a score and so on. 

Getting through the AoPS material and seeing how well you do in the AMC10/AMC12 is a good benchmark unto itself.

If you do well, it certainly counts for at schools like MIT. Even If you don't do well, it will only help do better at math related classes in college.

### American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME)

The [American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME)](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/American_Invitational_Mathematics_Examination) is the second exam in the series of exams used to challenge bright students on the path toward choosing the team that represents the United States at the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO). High scoring AMC 10 and AMC 12 students are invited to take the AIME. While most AIME participants are high school students, some bright middle school students also qualify each year.

The AIME is a 15 question, 3 hour exam taken by high scorers on the AMC 10, AMC 12, and USAMTS competitions. Qualification through USAMTS only is rare, however. Each answer is an integer from 000 to 999, inclusive, making guessing almost futile. Wrong answers receive no credit, while correct answers receive one point of credit, making the maximum score 15. Problems generally increase in difficulty as the exam progresses - the first few questions are generally AMC 12 level, while the later questions become extremely difficult in comparison. Calculators are not permitted.

### Mathematics Olympiad (USAMO/USAJMO)

High scoring AIME students are invited to take the prestigious 
- United States of America Mathematics Olympiad (USAMO) for qualification from taking the AMC 12 or
- United States of America Junior Mathematics Olympiad (USAJMO) for qualification from taking the AMC 10.

## Is there a community?

The Math club in most schools would be geared towards preparing for the AMC exams. Anyone who is preparing for these exams and is part of the Math club then automatically ends up taking part in local competitions etc.

Otherwise, there is a very active online community on AoPs which discusses all sorts of Math all the way through to college courses.

There are also online classes offered by AoPS if you don't want to study on your own and need to be part of a class.
