_"We approach everything at Airbnb through a design lens. For us, design is not just about how things look but also how they work. We have redesigned almost every element of the guest, Host and employee experience over the last three years, and it has transformed our culture, our products, and our community. Iâ€™ll share how we did it, some of the difficult moments along the way, and how we kept design and creativity at the center of everything."_
