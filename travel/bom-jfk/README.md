Air India appears to have stopped using the old Delta wet-leases and switched to an older [Etihad 777 300ER](https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Etihad_Airways/Etihad_Airways_Boeing_777-300ER_new.php) with 8 seats in First Class, 40 flat bed seats in Business Class, and 282 standard seats in Economy.

### !! Warning

Passengers with confirmed seats booked in March/April for departure in June will find that their seat assignments look different from what they thought they had booked.

## March 2024

Air India was flying the Delta 777 200-ER (77W) Delta One layout with 28-32 flat bed seats in Business Class, 32/40(?) seats in Premium Economy and the rest in Economy.

### Cabin Lighting

Cabin Lighting in economy [could not be turned off](https://www.businesstoday.in/industry/aviation/story/air-india-detects-cabin-lighting-issue-in-b777-planes-economy-class-419433-2024-02-29) in the 777-200 planes leased from Delta. As unbelievable as this sounds, I recall waking up on one flight and wondering why the lights were still on. The crew member told me that the lights could not be turned off. I remember thinking that this ranked among the more unebelievable excuses I had ever heard. I found afterwards that they were telling the truth.
