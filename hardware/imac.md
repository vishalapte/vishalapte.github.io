## iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch 2020)

Processor: 3.8GHz 8-core 10th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 5.0GHz
<br>Memory: 8 GB 2667 MHz DDR4
<br>Graphics: AMD Radeon Pro 5500 XT with 8 GB of GDDR6 memory
<br>Storage: 1TB SSD Storage
<br>Cost: **₹2,39,900**

One of the big reasons that I like this model is that it is the rare model that one can upgrade oneself.

> The current 5K iMac design is unique, because it’s the only Mac machine 
> that Apple sells outside of the $6,000 Mac Pro that features user-upgradable 
> memory. Thanks to a special door just above the power socket on the rear of 
> the 27-inch iMac, users can quickly gain access to the machine’s four SO-DIMM 
> slots to upgrade the RAM.

## Memory

Apple pricing on memory is expensive and offensive and the savings of DIY are huge.

## UPS

You don't want an expensive machine and unpredictable power supply. 
The cost of a UPS is money well spent because it will protect your
iMac.
